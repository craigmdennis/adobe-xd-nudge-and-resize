# Nudge & Resize for Adobe XD
Adds menu items for nudging and resizing objects (currently by 8px) so they can be controlled by keyboard shortcuts.

1. Search for and install "Nudge & Resize" in Adobe XD plugins directory
2. Set keyboard shortcuts

## Changing the nudge/resize amount
If someone would like to help me write a settings menu then great. Until then, please open the `plugins` folder after it's been installed, open `main.js` and substitute `8` for whatever you like.
